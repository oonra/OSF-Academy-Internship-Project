/*  
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The breakpoint mixins below were included to the parts of the code where custom css and scss
    were used. Bootstrap's default breakpoints were also used in the code, too, with some little
    adjustments respectful to the project requirements.

    - Default "xl" breakpoint of Bootstrap has been changed from min-width:1200px to min-width:1280px.
    - Default "lg" breakpoint of Bootstrap has been changed from min-width:992px to min-width:950px.
    - Default "md" breakpoint of Bootstrap was already assigned to min-width:768px by default.

    These changes have been made inside the main scss file of the project, "../globalbootstrap.scss",
    where all of bootstrap and scss files in the project are imported to.
